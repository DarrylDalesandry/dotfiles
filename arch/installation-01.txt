Part 1: First time booting into live ISO
========================================

From: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide

The default console keymap is "us". Standard US keyboards will work.

The keymap options can be viewed and changed with the commands:

------------------------------
# localectl list-keymaps
# loadkeys us
------------------------------


Fonts are located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/

These can be viewed with the command:

------------------------------
# ls /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/
------------------------------

Then, a font can be set with the command "setfont" followed by the name
 of the font inside the "consolefonts" folder.

------------------------------
# setfont ter-132b
# setfont default8x16
------------------------------

The "ter-132b" console font is a larger style font for high DPI displays.
The "default8x16" console font is the default size font matching the display.

The default font may be too small to read if a monitor's resolution is
 particularly high, so the "ter-132b" font is recommended for high DPI displays.

The "showconsolefont" command shows four 8x8 grids of all the characters
 available in the selected font. This results in 256 characters. Thats 2^8,
  8 bits to differentiate all characters.

------------------------------
# showconsolefont
------------------------------




Verifying the boot mode is also a good idea, to make sure that a 64 bit version
 of Arch is being run.

------------------------------
# cat /sys/firmware/efi/fw_platform_size
------------------------------

The command should return 64 for a 64-bit system, and 32 for a 32-bit system.



Internet connectivity can be verified by running the following command:

------------------------------
# ip link
------------------------------

This will return all network devices found. Network interface that are active,
 such as an Ethernet cable, will show an "Up" status.

To then test if the internet is working, a simple ping can be made.

------------------------------
# ping -4 ping.archlinux.org -c 8
------------------------------

The "-4" is used to send IPv4 pings rather than IPv6, just in case IPv6 does
 not work. The addition of "-c 8" means that 8 pings will be made before the
  command ends.

In Windows, the "ping" command only sends four ICMP requests, and stop. Linux,
 the "ping" command doesn't stop unless the process is terminated "CTRL+C", or
  the "-c" parameter is set telling how many requests to make before stopping.


The system clock can be verified as being synced with the command:

------------------------------
# timedatectl
------------------------------

This will return the current information of date and time. The key "System clock
 syncrhonized" should show a value of "yes" to make sure it is working.




Next up, is the partition table. The instructions below will be used to make
 a partition for the bootloader, and a second partition for both the operating
  system and the "/home" directories for personal files. The second partition
   will be encrypted, and use the btrfs file system.

Another popular partition style is to make a boot partition, an OS partition,
 and a third partition for "/home" directories. The advantage of this setup is
  that a different OS can be installed on the OS partition, and all personal
   files remain in the "/home" partition. There is no data lost. The downside,
    is that knowledge is needed for how much space the OS needs to function,
     and how much space is needed in the "/home" partition to function.

If the home or the OS partition become full, from adding too many packages to
 the Arch system, or using too much space in the home partition, then managing
  the partitions to adjust space between the two is a bit of a fun challenge.

I don't plan on Arch breaking on me, that would result in me not being able to
 fix it. So I'm using the easier two-partition model rather than the three.

First, list the current drives and their partitions:

------------------------------
# fdisk -l
------------------------------

In this case, the primary drive is an NVME drive, which appears as:
nvme0n1

Below, when the last step is executed, the "w" command in fdisk, this will
 remove all previous partitions, making data inaccessible without specialized
  software or tools. Make sure the drive is safe to wipe before starting.

The configuration with the commands below will create a partition with a boot
 partition, and a root partition.

------------------------------
# fdisk /dev/nvme0n1
# g     // create an empty GPT partition table
# n     // create new partition
# enter // default partition number, 1
# enter // default first sector, 2048
# +1G   // last sector is set at 1 Gigabyte from first sector
# y     // remove previous partition signature
# t     // change partition type, first partition will be selected
# 1     // selects EFI System Partition for partition 1
# n     // create new partition
# enter // default partition number, 2
# enter // default starting sector, after partition 1
# enter // default ending sector, using up remaining sectors of drive
# w     // save partition and write to disk
------------------------------


Run the comamnd below again, to verify that the disk partitions are created
 as intended:

------------------------------
# fdisk -l
------------------------------




From:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/EFI_system_partition

Now that all partitions are created, a file system then need added to each
 partition so that data can be stored on them.

The partition that will be used for EFI, partition 1, should be a FAT32
 file system, which will be compliant with UEFI specifications.

------------------------------
# mkfs.fat -F 32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
------------------------------

The second partition will first be setup as a LUKS drive (Linux Unified Key
 Setup). LUKS is an encryptoin sepcification, which locks a drive, and doesn't
  allow the drive to have a file system installed until after the drive is
   unlocked.

When fully setup, this will allow the drive to be encrypted, and require a
 password to decrypt the drive every time the computer boots.

The commands to setup LUKS are:

------------------------------
# cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/nvme0n1p2
# YES
# (enter passphrase)
# (enter passphrase again to set)
------------------------------


To verify that LUKS is enabled, run the below command:

------------------------------
# lsblk -f
------------------------------

This will show all drives, and their filesystem type among other information.
 The drive "nvme0n1p2" should have "crypto_LUKS" set as its filesystem type,
  even though LUKS is not a filesystem.

The LUKS partition, number 2, will then need to be opened in order to add the
 btrfs filesystem to the empty encrypted partition, using the alias "root" in
  this example. The alias can be anything.

------------------------------
# cryptsetup open /dev/nvme0n1p2 root
# (enter passphrase)
------------------------------

Running "lsblk -f" again, should show a child partition under nvme0n1p2 as
 "root", or any other alias that is written.

To access this partition, it is mapped as "/dev/mapper/root", replace "root"
 with the alias name set previously.


A list of filesystems is at:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/File_systems


The opened partition can then have a file system assigned to it.

------------------------------
# mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/root
------------------------------

Running "lsblk -f" again, should show "btrfs" as the filesystem type for "root",
 or the alias chosen to name it.




The partitions can now be mounted. This will be needed to "chroot" into the
 mounted filesystem and add all the files needed to make an Arch Linux system.

Below are the commands to mount the partitions, the file system partition,
 number 2, will be the root of the Arch operating system, mounted at "/mnt".
  The efi partition, number 1, is a child of the root partition, so it is
   mounted second as "/mnt/efi".

------------------------------
# mount /dev/mapper/root /mnt
# mount --mkdir /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/efi
------------------------------




All the packages needed to get an Arch Linux system running need installed.
 This starts by selecting the appropriate mirrors that store Arch packages.

------------------------------
# vim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
------------------------------

The "mirrorlist" file assigns priority of the mirrors from top to bottom.
 Whatever web address is closer to the top of the file will be checked first,
  before switching to files lower in the list.

For my geographical region, the United States, I prioritize mirrors hosted in
 the United States to get the fastest download speeds available. The closer
  a mirror is to where someone lives, the faster and more reliable the transfer
   of data.

The "U" in "United States" means that the region that hosts the mirrors I
 want will be near the bottom of the list, it is also in alphabetical order
  under the "World mirrors". So I move the "United States" mirrors to the top
   of the file, above the "World mirrors" listings.




Here is something exciting. It's time to install all the files, firmware, and
 binary blobs that make up the Arch Linux operating system to the nvme drive.

Run the command below:

------------------------------
# pacstrap -K /mnt base linux linux-firmware btrfs-progs intel-ucode linux-firmware-intel alsa-utils networkmanager sudo ntp ufw apparmor neovim 
------------------------------

The packages are:
- base: base system of linux
- linux: the latest stable kernel for Arch
- linux-firmware: firmware to be installed alongside the kernel
- btrfs-progs: a btrfs userspace utilitiy
- intel-ucode: Intel microcode
- linux-firmware-intel: firmware for intel devices: bluetooth, audio, and others
- alsa-utils: package for audio, Advanced Linux Sound Architecture
- networkmanager: managing ethernet networks
- sudo: used to allow elevated commands to run
- ntp: Network Time Protocol daemon for synchronizing system time
- ufw: uncomplicated firewall
- apparmor: mandatory access control security package
- neovim: a text editor that can be run in a terminal

My system runs an Intel CPU, an Intel GPU, on an Intel motherboard. So, all
 firmware I have listed above is for an Intel system.

If Wi-Fi is desired, then include "iwd" inside the list of apps that
 "pacstrap" installs. This is an app that allows Wi-Fi connectivity when
  running Arch in a tty using the "iwctl" command, among the other packages
   that can connect a sytem to a network via Wi-FI.


For more on iwd, see:
https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd




With that, a base Arch installation is setup. But it is not yet ready to be
 logged into. But this is a good stopping point to reflect on the work done
  so far.

The installation guide will continue in the next file.
