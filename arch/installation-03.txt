Part 3: Booting into Arch
========================================

At this step, the following should have been completed:


From the first installation instruction file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Drives should have partitions created
- Each partition should have a file system setup on them
- Base packages should have been installed through "pacstrap" command
- The home partition and /efi partition should be mounted



From the second installation instruction file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- The system time zone should have been set
- Network Time Protocols setup
- The /efi partition is hardened
- Initialization scripts configured for boot images
- Kernel parameters setup to decrypt the encrypted drive on start
- Bootloader is installed
- Important daemons are enabled




At this step, Arch should be able to boot, and login with the "root" account
 using the password set at the end of of the last file.

The daemons enabled in the previous step should be running when the "root"
 account logs in. For each package, it would be a good idea to make sure they
  are running. The status of each daemon can be found with the command:

------------------------------
# systemctl status {name-of-daemon}
------------------------------

If the daemon is not found, they can be started and enabled with the command:

------------------------------
# systemctl start {name-of-daemon}
# systemctl enable {name-of-daemon}
------------------------------

In this regard, enabling a daemon means that system-d will start the daemon
 when the system starts. This is important, because some services like a
  firewall and network-time-protocols should be run on when the system boots.




Manual pages are going to be important as well. This is what allows the "man"
 command to work. Below will install the "man" command, the database that
  "man" uses, and will sync the current manual databases.

------------------------------
# pacman -S man man-db
# mandb
------------------------------




This is a good time to create the user account. The goal here is to make sure
 that a user account is created, has its own home directory, and is part
  of the administrative group so that "sudo" will allow elevated commands
   to run.

------------------------------
# useradd -m {username}
# passwd {username}
# usermod -aG wheel {username}
------------------------------

Arch is a distrubiton that uses the "wheel" group to specify accounts that have
 elevated permissions through the "sudo" command. Other distributions may use
  a "sudo" group.

After adding the user account to the "wheel" group, the "sudoers" file will
 then need to be edited to allow members of the "wheel" group to have full
  permissions to use elevated commands.

What is important here, is to use the "visudo" command when editing. This is
 very important to make sure no syntax errors pop up, and that the sudoers file
  will not be interrupted before the changes to the text file are implemented.

The "visudo" command creates a temporary file that is checked, and implemented
 when verified as being correct. If this is not set correctly, then no
  elevated commands will ever work. Which is why editing the file directly
   is not recommended.

Because I have Neovim installed as my text editor, my command to edit the
 sudoers file will be a little different.

------------------------------
# EDITOR=nvim visudo
------------------------------

When editing the suoders file, uncomment line 125, to allow the "wheel" group
 to have the ability to execute any command. Write, and save.

A test can be run to make sure it works by editing a file that is outside of
 user space:

------------------------------
# sudo nvim /etc/hosts
------------------------------

A password should be prompted, and if opened, then the user account now has
 the ability to run escalated commands using "sudo".

 At this point, reboot your system, log into your user account, and make sure
  you can run the elevated command above to edit the "hosts" file, and 
   perform system updates with the "sudo" command.




With that, the "root" account can now be disabled. On Linux systems, the "root"
 account is a default admin account, so disabling it will make the system more
  secure. Default usernames are recommended to be changed, or removed, to
   prevent predictable names for accounts.

The /etc/shadow file is the local storage of all password hashes. This file
 should never be shared or seen. It is absolutely important that this file
  is never leaked.

Run the command:

------------------------------
# sudo nvim /etc/shadow
------------------------------

The first row will start with "root:......" where the "......" are a bunch of
 numbers, symbols, and characteres of a password hash.

Change the first row to:
------------------------------
root:!......
------------------------------

That is, a "!" should be added after "root:", and before the long bunch of
 numbers, letters, and symbols.

The cryptographic algorithm that sets password in Linux cannot produce a "*" or
 "!" character. So adding one of these characters produces a hash that cannot
  possibly be made, effectively disabling the account from being logged into.

Rebooting the system, and logging into the user account should now be safe.




At this step, logging in is being done through the tty. In order to have a
 fancier login screen, what needs setup next is a Display Manager. In Linux,
  the Display Manager is the screen that appears when wanting to log into
   a desktop enironment or a tty.

The display manager I like is called "greetd". Which is a framework that
 developers can build on to make their own login screen either in text or
  a graphical environment. The one I like is "tuigreet", which is a text based
   display manager.

For more on display managers and the different kinds, see:

https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Display_manager


To setup "greetd" with "tuigreet":

------------------------------
# sudo pacman -S greetd
# sudo pacman -S greetd-tuigreet
------------------------------

With both installed, the greeting service, tuigreet, will need configured.

------------------------------
# sudo nvim /etc/greetd/config.toml
------------------------------

In this file:
- Line 4, set "vt" to "next"
--- This will make sure that text from the system's startup tty doesn't
     overwrite tuigreet.

- As a single line, add the following:

------------------------------
command = "tuigreet --remember --asterisks --time --time-format \"%d-%B-%Y ||
%H:%M:%S\" --window-padding 2 --greeting \"Welcome to the World of Friendly
Computing!\" --theme \"text=white;time=green;container=black;title=mag
enta;border=green;greet=cyan;prompt=green;input=white;action=green;button=cyan\"
--cmd /bin/bash"
------------------------------

The single-line above is a colorful text theme showing the current date, time,
 and a welcome message.

To enable greetd, run the system-d command to enable.

------------------------------
# sudo systemctl enable greetd
------------------------------

This will start the "greetd" service, running "tuigreet" on boot.

Reboot the system, and check out the new login screen.
