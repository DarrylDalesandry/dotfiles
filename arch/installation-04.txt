Part 4: The Desktop Environment
========================================

At this step, the following should have been completed:


From the first installation instruction file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Drives should have partitions created
- Each partition should have a file system setup on them
- Base packages should have been installed through "pacstrap" command
- The home partition and /efi partition should be mounted



From the second installation instruction file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- The system time zone should have been set
- Network Time Protocols setup
- The /efi partition is hardened
- Initialization scripts configured for boot images
- Kernel parameters setup to decrypt the encrypted drive on start
- Bootloader is installed
- Important daemons are enabled




From the third installation instruction file
-------------------------------------------------------------------
- Man pages are installed
- A user account was made
- The user account was added to the wheel group
- The sudoers file was updated to allow the wheel group to have full access
- The root account was disabled
- A display manager was installed
- A text user interface greeter is installed
- Services are enabled and confirmed working




This is the time to then get a desktop environment setup. I've chosen to have
 the Cosmic desktop be installed as my "easy to use" desktop environment.

From the tty session, it is time to get this installed.

------------------------------
# sudo pacman -S cosmic-session
# sudo pacman -S cosmic-terminal
------------------------------

This will first ask for what source to install Vulkan drivers. The default is
 from Nvidia-utils, but since I am running with an Intel GPU, the choice I
  make is for option 7, vulkan-intel.

This will ask for over 200 packages to be installed, which include everything
 from a Wayland compositor, to pipewire and wireplumber to manage audio.

A terminal is not installed with this bundle, so this will need to be installed
 separately before starting a session into Cosmic.

After all packages are installed, the Cosmic desktop environment can be
 started with the command:

------------------------------
# start-cosmic
------------------------------

The Cosmic desktop environment will load, and provide a very empty looking
 session.




A very barebones Cosmic is installed, so to flesh it out, additional packages
 will need installed:

------------------------------
# sudo pacman -S firefox
# sudo pacman -S cosmic-text-editor
# sudo pacman -S cosmic-store
------------------------------

firefox: web browser. Will ask for audio an provider, which should be 
          pipewire-jack
cosmic-text-editor: graphical based text editor with vim motion support
cosmic-store: application store

What is very important, is that the cosmic-store will also install flatpak.

Flatpak is a containerized application solution to allow packages to be
 installed that are agnostic to the specific Linux operating system.

The most remote, another word for a flatpak repository, is flathub. To add
 this, 



The command below should be written as a single line, no spaces between lines.

------------------------------
# flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
------------------------------

This will produce a warning that applications installed through Flatpak will
 not show up on the desktop until a new session.



From here, a reboot is needed. The audio drivers and packages, alsa, pipewire,
 and wireplumber, will activate, providing a working desktop environment to
  personalize from here.

From this, an operational, and secure, environment should be setup and ready to
 install additional packages and customizations.
